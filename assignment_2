# Question 1: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the following operations:
# Addition
# Subtraction
# Multiplication
# Division
# Modulus
# Display the results for each operation.
# num1 =int(input("Enter the First number :"))
# num2 =int(input("Enter the Second number :"))
# x=num1
# y=num2
# Addition=x+y
# Subtraction=x-y
# Multiplication=x*y
# Division=x/y
# Modulus=x%y
#
# print("Addition of num1 and num 2 :",Addition)
# print("Subtraction of num1 and num 2 :",Subtraction)
# print("Multiplication of num1 and num 2 :",Multiplication)
# print("Division of num1 and num 2 :",Division)
# print("Modulus of num1 and num 2 :",Modulus)

#Question 2: Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator.


num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(num is even.")
else:
    print(num is odd.")
