# Question 1: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the following operations:
# Addition
# Subtraction
# Multiplication
# Division
# Modulus
# Display the results for each operation.
# num1 =int(input("Enter the First number :"))
# num2 =int(input("Enter the Second number :"))
# x=num1
# y=num2
# Addition=x+y
# Subtraction=x-y
# Multiplication=x*y
# Division=x/y
# Modulus=x%y
#
# print("Addition of num1 and num 2 :",Addition)
# print("Subtraction of num1 and num 2 :",Subtraction)
# print("Multiplication of num1 and num 2 :",Multiplication)
# print("Division of num1 and num 2 :",Division)
# print("Modulus of num1 and num 2 :",Modulus)

#Question 2: Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is even or odd using the modulus operator.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(num is even.")
else:
    print(num is odd.")
#Question 3: Write a Python program that takes a number as input from the user and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero.
# a=int(input("Enter the First number: "))
# if(a==0):
#     print("input is zero")
# elif(a<0):
#     print("input is negative")
# else:
#     print("input is positive")
#Question 4: Write a Python program that calculates the grade of a student based on the marks entered by the user. The grading scale is as follows:
#90 and above: A
#80 - 89: B
#70 - 79: C
#60 - 69: D
#Below 60: F

marks = float(input("Enter the student's marks (out of 100): "))
if marks >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif 80 <= marks < 90:
    grade = "B"
elif 70 <= marks < 80:
    grade = "C"
elif 60 <= marks < 70:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

#Question 5: Write a Python program to create a text file called sample.txt and write the sentence "Hello, this is a sample file." to the file. Then, read and display the content from the file.
with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, this is a sample file")
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("Content of sample.txt:")
    print(content)


#Question 6: Write a Python program that reads a text file called data.txt and counts the number of words in the file.

# Open the text file in read mode
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
# Split the content into words
words = content.split()

# Count the number of words
word_count = len(words)

# Display the word count
print(f"The file 'data.txt' contains {word_count} words.")
